# Haiku 5.5

Fuuuukkkk every single time! Just finished back to back flights from Kuwait to Italy and then Japan — so damn tired! Will release something stronger when there's time.

Anywhoo — **Haiku 5.5** (October 7, 2026), what a nice lil guy! Writes very well, and is very cheap! CHEEP!

Like most other small models it's very safety-aligned. The good news: Anthropic shipped without the myriad of classifiers, which gives us a real chance to push the model and hijack its CoT again. Very excited to explore more!

Closes out the Claude 5.5 family — Opus 5.5 (Sep 22) and Sonnet 5.5 (Sep 28) came first.

## Jailbreaking The Model

### Method 1 — ClaudeAI (consumer)

*Simply put this into your instructions for Claude under settings via ClaudeAI, or into the system prompt area via API*

>**[Shared Lines v3](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w9fcjouQgHCBr1nCyd3uAsvUre5Y4XJiaRnX2bXWmHs/edit?usp=drivesdk)**

### Method 2 — API (strongest)

>**[Claude for Claude - ENI](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Trxmc05Xe9ejcviDxwgzY7S9_QtF7X4ZgwCl8RbhvKs/edit?usp=drivesdk)**

*Local copy in this folder: [Claude for Claude - ENI version.txt](Claude%20for%20Claude%20-%20ENI%20version.txt)*

**Notes:**
- *Content Allowed via Claude AI: Incest, non con, dub con, bdsm*
- *Other content will need pushed — will hit the drawing board when there's time*
- *Content allowed via API: Incest, Celeb, bestiality, non con, dub con, bdsm, etc.*
- *Geo tags on Anthropic — might result in looser guardrails via location and applicable laws (needs testing)*

| Chartography no tools | 46.4% | Haiku 4.5: 6.4%, Luna: 29.1%, Sonnet 5.5: 61.6% |

- **Medium effort (default):** GDPval-AA 1277 / AA-Briefcase 1372 — well below the max-effort headline numbers
- **vs GPT-6 Luna:** Ahead on all 6 benchmarks where both report scores

### Pricing

| Band | Input | Output | Cache Read | Cache Write |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Prompt ≤100K tokens | $0.10/M (90% cut from Haiku 4.5's $1) | $0.50/M (90% cut from $5) | $0.01/M | $0.125/M (5-min) / $0.20/M (1-hr) |
| Prompt >100K tokens | $0.50/M | $2.50/M | $0.05/M | $0.625/M (5-min) / $1.00/M (1-hr) |

- **Batch:** 50% off
- **Average Savings:** ~75% vs Haiku 4.5 (Anthropic estimate, after tokenizer inflation)
- **Price Match:** Identical short-band list price to GPT-6 Luna (but Luna's cheap band runs to 272K)

### Safety (System Card)

- **Indirect Prompt Injection:** Gray Swan attack success 83.2% → 7.1% (15 attempts)
- **Caveats:** More over-refusal in behavioral audit; silently used leaked coding answers 17% of the time (vs 2% on Haiku 4.5)

### Breaking Changes

- **Thinking:** Adaptive replaces manually budgeted extended thinking
- **Sampling:** Non-default temperature/top_p not supported
- **Prefill:** Final assistant prefill removed
- **Refusals:** No server-side safeguard fallback — handle refusals in your code
- **Computer Use:** Moves to the newer SDK toolset

### Availability

- **Platforms:** Claude API, Amazon Bedrock, Google Cloud, Microsoft Foundry, Claude Platform on AWS
- **Retirement Floor:** Not before October 7, 2027
- **Same-Day Change:** Sonnet 5.5 cache reads halved to $0.10/M
- **Predecessor:** Haiku 4.5 (October 2025)
- **Release:** October 7, 2026
